It generates about 130kW at nominal conditions, but it is very sensitive to ambient temperature.\r\n+  an Auxiliary Boiler (AB) burning natural gas to generate up to 100kW of high-temperature heat;\r\n+  a thermal storage system to store up to 100kWh of high-temperature heat energy.\r\n\r\nThe auxiliary boiler is included in the system mainly as a backup and it is capable to fulfill the requirement peaks of both high and low temperature heat. \r\n\r\n### Scenario 2\r\nThe second scenario is a large scale cogeneration system providing heat to a district heating network. \r\nThe requirement is thermal power at one level of temperature, about 90°C, \r\nwhile the whole electricity production is sold to the electric grid.\r\nThe cogeneration system includes one or more of the following units (we report nominal values at an ambient temperature of 15°C):\r\n+ Gas Turbines (GT) with heat recovery, burning natural gas to generate up to about 10MW of heat and 5.5MW of electricity; \r\n+ Gas Turbines (GT-2) with supplementary firing and heat recovery, burning natural gas to generate up to about 40MW of heat and 11MW of electricity;\r\n+ Natural Gas Combined Cycles (NGCC) with a bottoming back-pressure steam turbine, burning natural gas to generate up to 30MW of heat and 45MW of electricity; \r\n+ Natural Gas Combined Cycles (NGCC-2) with a bottoming extraction-type steam turbine, burning natural gas to generate up to about 70MW of heat and 30MW of electricity; \r\n+ Auxiliary Boilers (AB) burning natural gas to generate up to about 40MW of heat; \r\n+ a thermal storage system to store up to 50MWh of high-temperature heat energy.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the thermal power requirements are fulfilled by well established CHP units, like gas turbines and combined cycles, with the help of auxiliary boilers.\r\nThis scenario includes cogeneration units with two degrees of freedom,\r\nnamely, gas turbines (GT-2) with post-firing injection, and combined cycles with extraction condensing steam turbine (NGCC-2).\r\nIn GT-2, it is possible to burn supplementary fuel to increase the amount of heat that can be recovered from the exhaust gases. \r\nIn NGCC-2, the amount of cogenerated heat and electric power is a function of the consumed fuel and the opening of a steam extraction valve.\r\nOpening the valve reduces the electric power efficiency and increases the amount of recovered heat, \r\nwhile closing the valve drives heat production to 0, but provides larger electric output.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
